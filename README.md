## ABOUT THE PROJECT

I have developed a website dedicated to showcasing a wide array of PC components. These components are conveniently categorized into sections such as CPUs, RAM, monitors, motherboards, storage devices, and power supplies. Each component boasts its own dedicated details page, providing users with comprehensive information.

A particularly noteworthy feature is the "PC Builder" page, which is exclusively accessible to authenticated users.
